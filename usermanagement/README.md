# User-Management

Whenever a new user is created These Things Happens,
 - Assigns a UID (unique id) to a user
 - Creates a folder of that user in home directory
 - Sets the default shell of the user to be /bin/sh
 - Creates a private user group, named after the username
 - .bashrc and .bash_logout are copied to the home directory of new user. These files provide environment variables for this userâ€™s session.
